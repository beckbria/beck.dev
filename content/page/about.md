I'm a software developer from the Seattle area.  I'm passionate about user interfaces and security.  When not working, I'm interested in participating in and running puzzle events ([Puzzle Hunts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Puzzle_Hunt), not jigsaws), bicycling, and beer.  I can be reached at brian dot beck at outlook dot com.
